💳 Net Banking System
This project is a basic online banking web application developed as a group project using JSP, Servlets, and JDBC. It simulates common features of real-world net banking systems and helped us as a team to understand how web applications interact with databases.
We worked together to handle frontend (using JSP), backend logic (Servlets), and database operations (JDBC + MySQL). The system is simple but covers key functionalities found in any online banking portal.

👨‍💻 Team Members
We collaborated to divide tasks like:
Designing JSP pages
Writing Servlet logic
Handling database operations
Testing and debugging
This teamwork helped us understand modular development in Java web apps.



✅ Features
The system supports:
User Login (account number + password)
Balance Check
Money Transfer (between users)
Transaction History
Account Details View

🛠 Technologies Used
Java (Servlets)
JSP (Frontend)
JDBC (Database Connectivity)
MySQL (Database)
HTML & CSS (for basic styling)
We didn’t use any advanced frameworks intentionally, to focus on core Java EE concepts.



🧾 Sample Users
We tested the application with two dummy users:

331966426 – Virat Kohli – kohli@5101

331964880 – Rohit Sharma – sharma@5101




🎯 What We Learned
Servlet lifecycle and form handling
JSP page design and dynamic content
How JDBC connects Java code with databases
Session handling and request-response cycle
Working as a team and dividing logic layer-wise



🚀 How to Run Locally
Import project in IntelliJ / Eclipse
Set up Apache Tomcat server
Configure MySQL and update connection URL
Deploy and run on localhost:8080
Use sample users to log in



❗ Notes
This is a basic level academic project
Security and validation are kept simple
Meant for learning and demonstration purposes
